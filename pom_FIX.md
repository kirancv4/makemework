Error 1
error:- Temperature was not of integer datatype, spliting of the temperature was incorrect .
approach:- Understood the splitting of the temperature and made changes to split function of temperature in Main_Page.py .

Error 2
error:- KeyError.
approach:- Looked up "Key Error" in Google. I Understood A Python KeyError exception is what is raised when you try to access a key that isnâ€™t in a dictionary (dict). Searched the code for any dict type found in "e2e_weather_shopper_conf.py" changed the key.

Error 3
error:- Conditional check
Could not obtain the cheapest product with the filter condition 'aloe'
Check the screenshots to see if there was at least one item that satisfied the filter condition.

product.price <= min_price

Error 5
:Stop_Test_Exception('Stopping test because: Automation is not on the cart page') 

I think that its not able to locate the xpath of checkout button.
approach : In the error messages I founded out that the cart button was not able to get clicked, due to the xpath issue(//button[@onclick='goTocart']) I traced it back to the locators_conf.py file and checked if the xpath works or not.

Fix:- changed the xpath to [//button[@onclick='goToCart']

Error 6
AttributeError("'Main_Page' object has no attribute 'verify_cart'")
I think the page is traversing to "Main_Page"  instead of verifying weather the page has landed to "cart page" or not.

Fix:Rename the the 'main' to 'cart' in cart page.

Error 7
(List index out of bound)

Approach :Understood the concept of List and how its elements gets appended to the list.
          Each append statement appends one element at a time.
